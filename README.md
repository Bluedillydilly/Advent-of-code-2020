https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1
### Part One
iterate through a list and find two numbers that when added together equal 2020. Answer is the product of those two numbers.

## Day Two -- String Manipulation
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2
### Part One
Iterate through a list of 'password policies' and find those who are invalid. Formatted: ```a-b c: ssssssss``` where `a` is the max number of occurances of letter `c` in string `sss...` and `b` is the max number of occurrances. Policy is valid if string `s` contains between `a` and `b` (inclusive) number of letter `c` in it. Answer is count of valid passwords.
### Part Two 
Same as `Part One` but format is changed. Formatted: ```a-b c: sss...``` where `a` is the first index to check and `b` the second index. `c` is the letter to be checking for. Password is valid is letter at `a` of `sss...` is not the same as the letter at `b` of `sss...` and one of them is `c`. Answer is count of valid passwords.
